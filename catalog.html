Object-oriented programming and its concomitant design patterns provide rich abstractions for program development. These programs will eventually execute on real hardware, however. This course will investigate advanced object-oriented techniques and how they interact with hardware and operating system issues. We will ground our topics in C++, but the goal of the course will be to develop understanding that can be applied across languages. We will examine different design techniques for things such as memory management, and explore how and why they differ in performance and robustness. We will also cover idioms such as ""Resource Acquisition Is Initialization"" (RAII) and how they can be used to provide robust resource management for exceptions (exception safety). We will also devote time to covering generic programming and related topics such as expression templates. This is a growing area that seeks to decouple algorithms and data structures through the use of templates and other meta-programming techniques. These techniques exploit the fact that the C++ template mechanism is a language-within-a-language that is executed at compile-time rather than run-time. Additional topics include dynamic linking for techniques such as ""plug-ins"", template instantiation mechanisms, template specialization, idioms for memory management, thread-safety issues, thread-safety, C++ reflection.

Object-oriented programming and its concomitant design patterns provide rich abstractions for program development. These programs will eventually execute on real hardware, however. This course will investigate advanced object-oriented techniques and how they interact with hardware and operating system issues. We will ground our topics in C++, but the goal of the course will be to develop understanding that can be applied across languages. We will examine different design techniques for things such as memory management, and explore how and why they differ in performance and robustness. We will also cover idioms such as "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization" (RAII) and how they can be used to provide robust resource management for exceptions (exception safety). We will also devote time to covering generic programming and related topics such as expression templates. This is a growing area that seeks to decouple algorithms and data structures through the use of templates and other meta-programming techniques. These techniques exploit the fact that the C++ template mechanism is a language-within-a-language that is executed at compile-time rather than run-time. Additional topics include dynamic linking for techniques such as "plug-ins", template instantiation mechanisms, template specialization, idioms for memory management, thread-safety issues, thread-safety, C++ reflection.

This hands-on course covers offensive and defensive technologies in the area of software security. Particularly, students will learn about various vulnerabilities that lead to software compromise, attacks that exploit such vulnerabilities, and defenses that defend against such attacks. Topics covered include simple control-flow corruption attacks, slightly harder buffer overflow and return-to-libc attacks, advanced ROP attacks, Meltdown and Spectre attacks on the hardware. Students are expected to not only learn the concepts behind each attack, but also execute them in a controlled environment. Prerequisite: Undergraduate Operating Systems. Term offered varies. 3 credits.

This course focuses on techniques that approach cyber security problems in a principled manner using concepts from data mining, game theory, graph theory, and psychology. The intent of this course is to permit students to bridge the divide between real-world cyber threats and formal, scientific foundations of solutions that address such threats. Real-world cyber security issues, such as spamming, phishing attacks, malware, sybil attacks in social networks, and DDoS attacks, are used to illustrate how cyber threats can be modeled with abstract representations that are amenable to rigorous analysis and formal reasoning. The course also emphasizes the development of cyber defense mechanisms that are rooted in scientific foundations. Prerequisite: Undergraduate Operating Systems and Algorithms.

The landscape of computation platforms has changed dramatically in recent years. Computing devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are on the horizon. Big data processing becomes an indispensable part of numerous applications. Multi-core CPUs are commonly deployed in computer systems. Programming on these emerging platforms remains a challenging task. This course introduces a number of state-of-the-art programming models on these platforms, and further explores the frontier of next-generation programming language design that may potentially impact the future programming practice for emerging platforms. In particular, the course investigates UAV programming, Big Data programming, and multi-core programming, with additional presentations on other platforms on the rise. Applications of these programming models range from high-performance computing, cyber-physical systems, databases, to energy-conscious systems.
